# Simple Todo Reconciler

This project is a simple implementation of a reconciler for managing a todo list in the browser. The reconciler is responsible for efficiently updating the user interface based on changes in the todo state.

## Reconciliation Process
The reconciliation process efficiently updates the UI by identifying and handling three types of changes: added, deleted, and updated todos. The goal is to minimize unnecessary DOM manipulations.
